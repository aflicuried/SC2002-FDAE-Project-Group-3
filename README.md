- [Javadoc]()

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or above.
- An IDE (recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions).

### Project Setup
1. Clone or download the project
   - If using git, type in *gh repo clone aflicuried/SC2002-FDAE-Project-Group-3* into the terminal.
   - Alternatively, download and extract the zip file.
2. Open the project in IDE
   - Open the root folder (SC2002-FDAE-Project-Group-3) as a project.
   - If prompted, import as a Java project.
3. Check project structure
   - Source code is in the src/ directory.
   - Main entry point: src/Main.java
   - Supporting packages: Database, Entity, Interface, Service, View, util.
4. Configure the Java SDK
   - In your IDE, ensure the project SDK is set to Java 17 or higher.
5. (If using Eclipse/IntelliJ) Import project files
   - For Eclipse:
     - Use File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
     - Select the root directory.
   - For IntelliJ:
     - Open the project directory directly. IntelliJ will auto-detect .iml files.
     
## Building and Running:
1. From the IDE:
   - Right-click Main.java and select Run.
2. From the Command Line:
   - Navigate to the src directory and run the following code in the terminal:
     - *cd src*
     - *javac Main.java*
     - *java Main*
3. Data Files:
   - The application may read/write data from the data/ directory. Ensure this directory exists in the project root.
4. Troubleshooting:
   - If you encounter issues with missing classes, ensure all subfolders in src/ are included as packages in your IDE.
   - If you see file read/write errors, check that the data/ directory is present and accessible.
